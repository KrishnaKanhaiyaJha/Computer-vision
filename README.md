This project presents an **Eye Controlled Mouse** built with Python that allows users to control the system cursor using eye movements and perform mouse clicks through blinking, providing a touchless human–computer interaction experience. It uses **OpenCV** for real-time video capture, **MediaPipe Face Mesh** for accurate facial landmark detection, and **PyAutoGUI** to translate eye positions into screen cursor movement. The webcam tracks specific eye landmarks, maps their coordinates to the screen resolution, and moves the pointer accordingly, while a left-eye blink is detected by measuring the distance between eyelid landmarks to trigger a click event. The system works in real time, requires proper lighting and a functional camera, and demonstrates the practical implementation of computer vision in assistive technology, smart interfaces, and hands-free control applications.
